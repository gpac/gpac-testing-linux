-max-chain (int, default: 6):  set maximum chain length when resolving filter links. Default value covers for [ in -> ] demux -> reframe -> decode -> encode -> reframe -> mux [ -> out]. Filter chains loaded for adaptation (eg pixel format change) are loaded after the link resolution. Setting the value to 0 disables dynamic link resolution. You will have to specify the entire chain manually

-alsa-devname (string):        set ALSA dev name
